 *                invoice itself, so there is nothing for us to leak.
 *    • forever — a multi-cycle coupon. WE count billing cycles and detach it
 *                when the budget is spent, because Stripe's month-based
 *                duration is wrong here: `renewActivePlanIfExhausted` renews
 *                early whenever a user burns their minutes, so a heavy user
 *                can consume several cycles inside one calendar month and
