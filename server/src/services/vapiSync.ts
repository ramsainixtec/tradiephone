 * best-effort — an outage must never cost the owner their edits. The cost of
 * that ordering is a silent divergence: the dashboard shows the new settings
 * while real callers still hear the old ones, and nothing retries.
 *
 * So a failed push marks the conversion pending and the scheduler drains the
 * queue. The retry re-reads whatever config is saved NOW rather than replaying
 * the payload that failed, which makes it correct regardless of how many saves
 * happened in between — the live assistant converges on the latest config, and
 * the queue is idempotent (a redundant push is a no-op PATCH).
