 * ordinary decorative emoji, which is the intent: the capability should not
 * announce itself to anyone looking over an admin's shoulder or watching a
 * screen share.
 *
 * That concealment is worth EXACTLY nothing as security, and none is claimed
 * for it. `POST /customers/:id/impersonate` verifies a PIN server-side and
 * refuses without it; someone who found this trigger, or called the endpoint
 * directly, still cannot get in. This only decides who is *offered* the door.
 *
 * Everywhere else — every non-admin, and every other page — it renders as the
 * plain emoji it has always been, with no cursor change and nothing in the
 * accessibility tree to hint otherwise.
