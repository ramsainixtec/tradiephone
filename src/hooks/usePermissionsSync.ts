/**
 * Keeps a signed-in admin/staff member's cached permissions in sync with the
 * server, so an edit to their role (or a change to which role they're assigned)
 * takes effect without a manual page refresh.
 *
 * The server already authorizes every request against the live `permissions`
 * column — the role editor re-syncs all assigned members the moment it saves.
 * This hook refreshes the *cached* session (`loadMe()`) that drives the sidebar
 * links and per-section gating, on a short interval and whenever the tab regains
 * focus, so switching back to the tab reflects the change near-instantly.
 *
 * Scoped to admin/staff: only their permissions gate the UI, and it avoids the
 * per-`/me` subscription reconciliation a customer poll would trigger. During
 * impersonation the active role is USER, so this naturally pauses.
